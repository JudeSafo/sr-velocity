## [3.2.0] - 2021-09-22

### Added

- Added `DateTimeTickStrategy.setCursorFormatter` for easy modification of cursor ticks formatting.
- Added `NumericTickStrategy.setCursorFormatter` for easy modification of cursor ticks formatting.
- Added `TimeTickStrategy.setCursorFormatter` for modification of cursor ticks formatting.
- Added `axis.setThickness`.
    - This can be used to control the width or height of axis depending on is the axis Y or X axis.

### Changed

- Improved default Date time cursor formatting to display Year, month, day, hour and minute information. This can be modified with new method `DateTimeTickStrategy.setCursorFormatter`.
- Added `dataPoint` parameter to `SeriesXYFormatter`. This allows using `value`, `size`, `color`, `rotation` and custom values in cursor result table formatters.
- `ZoomBandChart` now automatically aligns itself with the reference chart.
- Community version no longer has performance penalty.
- `NumericTickStrategy.setFormattingFunction` now also affects default cursor result table formatting and cursor ticks formatting.

- Fixed point, line and range series `getPointAmount` not counting points that were added just before.
- Fixed empty series affecting automatic fitting of series.
- LightningChart JS logo now renders properly on high DPI devices with `window.devicePixelRatio` greater than 1.
- Fixed poor performance when adding new points to charts with 1 million or more points in some cases.
