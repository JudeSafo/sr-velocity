## Installation

### 1. Install from NPM and use a bundler

Install the library package from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arction/lcjs).

`npm install --save @arction/lcjs`

This package can be used with any bundler that supports CommonJS. Some examples of bundlers that work are [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en).

Check our [getting started video](https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js-faq/) on LightningChart JS to see this in action.

Any of our [Examples](https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js-interactive-examples/) can be used as a seed project. All examples on that page have been made to standalone repositories which can be found on our GitHub. [Standalone Example Repositories](https://github.com/Arction?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=lcjs-example&type=&language=)

### 2. Use IIFE bundle directly on a webpage

The library is distributed with a browser ready IIFE bundle. This bundle can be used directly in browsers with [script tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_JavaScript_within_a_webpage). You can see an example implementation of this method on our GitHub. [LightningChart JS html usage example.](https://github.com/Arction/lcjs-html-example)

All of our [examples](https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js-interactive-examples/) can be used in the html page. To use them,
first find an example you want to use from [interactive examples](https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js-interactive-examples/).
Click `Edit this example`. On the bottom of the page click on the button that reads `CJS`. That will switch our code to be IIFE compatible.
After that, the code can be copied to the html page. See our [LightningChart JS html usage example](https://github.com/Arction/lcjs-html-example) for more detailed information.

## License options

### Non-commercial, Community License

The Community License is distributed with the NPM package in a `LICENSE` file and can also be found from: https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js-eula-community/

When the library is used without a license, it will run with a LightningChart JS logo on the chart. The logo is a link to the LightningChart JS product page.

There is a small performance drop when the chart is running without a license key compared to running with a valid license.

### Commercial License

The Commercial License can be found from: https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js-eula-commercial/

If you are using any other license than the Community License then the Commercial License applies.

#### Development License

A development license is required for development in a commercial environment. The license is verified with a license server. Internet connection is required for license verification. Each developer requires own development license. See "[Using a license](#using-a-license)" for how to use the development license. When using a development key, the chart will just like it will in production.

#### Deployment License

A deployment license is required for commercial use. The deployment license is provided the same way as a development license. See "[Using a license](#using-a-license)" for how to use the deployment license.

When using a deployment license, the chart will render without the LightningChart JS logo. The deployment license supports a "Deployment Test" domain. If the domain that the library is currently running in matches the deployment test domain specified with the deployment license, the chart will render with a "Deployment Test" text on top of the chart. This domain is meant to support using a staging environment and having the ability to switch to the production version without changing the license.

#### Application Deployment License

An application deployment license is required for deploying any application on other platforms than the web. See "[Using a license](#using-a-license)" for how to use the application deployment license.

When using an application deployment license, the chart will render without the LightningChart JS logo.

## Purchasing

Different purchasing options can be found on [our website](https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js-pricing/).

## Getting started

### Javascript package

The library is distributed as a single _javascript_ _module_. Its _exports_ can be grouped to two categories:

#### lightningChart

This will be needed for every _lcjs_-application as it is required for creating _Charts_, _Dashboards_, _LegendBoxes_... Its usage is always the same:

```javascript
// Import library.
const { lightningChart } = require("@arction/lcjs");

// Create an instance of lightningChart for creation of charts.
const lc = lightningChart();

// Create charts using methods of 'LightningChart'-interface.
const cartesianChart = lc.ChartXY();
const spiderChart = lc.Spider();
// ...
```

<br/>

##### Using a license

To use your _LightningChart JS_ license, you must pass it as an argument to _lightningChart_, like so:

```javascript
// Create an instance of LightningChart for creation of charts.
// ----- Licensed version -----
const lc = lightningChart(myLicenseString);
```

`myLicenseString` can be either a development license for development or a deployment license for deployment.

To use your _LightningChart JS_ Application deployment license, you must also pass an object containing license information.

```javascript
// Create an instance of LightningChart for creation of charts.
// ----- Application Deployment licensed version -----
const lc = lightningChart(myLicenseString, licenseInformationObject);
```

The `licenseInformationObject` is an object that implements `AppDeploymentLicenseInformation` interface.

<br/>

#### Individual exports styles, settings, utilities, builders...

_LightningChart® JS_ also includes a bunch of other exports for styling, configuring and interacting with _charts_, building different _UI-elements_ and what-not. These can be imported from the _lcjs_ module as required:

```javascript
// Import required parts from LightningChart® JS module.
const {
    lightningChart,
    ColorRGBA,
    AxisScrollStrategies,
    // ...
} = require("@arction/lcjs");
```

Any entry listed in _LightningChart® JS API Documentation_ is importable as in the previous example.

### Example usage

```javascript
const { lightningChart, DataPatterns } = require("@arction/lcjs");

// Create a cartesian chart.
const chart = lightningChart().ChartXY();

// Add a series for rendering a line optimized for progressing by X.
const lineSeries = chart.addLineSeries({
    dataPattern: DataPatterns.horizontalProgressive,
});

// Append point locations. (Note that selected Data Pattern expects them to be progressive by X)
lineSeries.add([
    { x: 0, y: 0 },
    { x: 20, y: 0 },
    { x: 45, y: -47 },
    { x: 53, y: 335 },
    { x: 57, y: 26 },
    { x: 62, y: 387 },
    { x: 74, y: 104 },
    { x: 89, y: 0 },
    { x: 95, y: 100 },
    { x: 100, y: 0 },
]);
```
